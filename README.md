# Plugin

**Open Logic** is a plugin designed for creating custom visual scripting graphs with custom nodes.
It seamlessly integrates with the editor and supports shipping builds for game integration.

# Open Source
Originally, this plugin was sold on the Unreal Engine Marketplace from April 2022 to March 2025. However, I’ve decided to remove it for several reasons - primarily because I no longer have the time to maintain it. Rather than letting it fade away, I believe open-sourcing it on GitHub is the best way to give it a proper conclusion.

I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who supported me during this journey and purchased the plugin. Your encouragement meant a lot.

This was my first plugin and my first real experience with C++, so there are some questionable design decisions and a few unfinished features (e.g., the Wildcard type). Still, the plugin mostly works and can hopefully serve as a useful reference or starting point for others.
